Description: Package Overview

        You thought **Brainfuck** was bad? Think again. Get ready to meet...
        
        EPIC BRAINFUCK
        ==============

        Motivation
        ==========
        
        Contrary to many other codebases, this repository is not just about writing yet 
        
        **another** Brainfuck compiler. Just search "brainfuck" on GitHub, and you'll see
        
        just how many people have already written compilers, and how many different languages
        
        it has been written in. It's incredible for a language so basic and rudimentary, how
        
        much attention it has garnered over the years. Indeed, it is quite the brainteaser to
        
        write stuff using only eight characters.
        
        |
        
        However, "brainteaser" is perhaps a euphemism for the language's actual name, so I began 
        
        to think: how can I crank up the "brain-teasing" if you'd like and make this language even 
        
        more difficult to work with? The answer? Who said that ``>`` means ``++ptr``, where ``ptr`` points
        
        to an "infinitely long" ``char`` array? Why can't we use other characters to signify that? And who
        
        said we needed to have concrete aliases for these bits of C code? This is where this 
        
        Brainfuck package deviates from most. Not only did I write an interpreter for 
        
        "traditional" Brainfuck code, but I also wrote **several** variants in which the syntax of
        
        Brainfuck changes from interpretation to interpretation. Toss in some unexpected behaviors 
        
        (e.g. massive file write out of nowhere), and there you have it: **EPIC** Brainfuck shenanigans!
